Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Integration Project
Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B model to generate text responses from text prompts as well as multimodal responses for images. The project supports both text-based and multimodal (image) inputs using the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B model, allowing developers to leverage the power of AI in generating insightful responses and analyzing visual data.

Features
Text-based Input: Generates responses from a prompt using the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B model.
Multimodal Input: Supports image-based input, allowing the model to describe or analyze an image.
Efficient and Fast: Built for low compute tasks, ensuring quick response times while maintaining quality.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend JavaScript environment.
Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B: The AI model powering text and multimodal generation.
Prerequisites
Node.js installed (v14 or higher).
A valid API key for Google AI services with access to the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B model.
The genAI library installed to interface with Google's Generative AI services.
